# Second HSE coding assignment
## RightFigures
## Description
- Develop a console application that allows the user to filter the correct shapes located in text files. 
- The name of the file (not the path) with the data is supplied by the user to the input of the program.
- Filtering is carried out by using the methods described in the classes of the correct figures from the class library. 
- As a result of applying filtering, the program creates a new file.
- The file contains information about all figures lying in the first coordinate quadrant.
- The figures are sorted in descending order by the radius of the circumscribed circle.
